		  <h3> Warm </h3>
			<p> The project Warm, was the start and concept of a game created by some friends and I during the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program.
				The game was a way to promote mental health awareness in a way where people can get a better understanding. Currently, the game is unfinished
				and only has a general outline/concept through scratch and several other pieces of paper. In the future, I plan to work on the game further as
				well as finish polishing the website for it as well. </p>
