		  <h2> Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program (2018) </h2> <br>

			<p>
				During the summer, Courtney was accepted into a coding program that empowers girls and creates a sisterhood among the girls.
				Within the program, there were many opportunities to meet many different people as well as gain connections with the people
				thehy met with. It has built a sense of community through all the people who were involved in the summer program. Career wise, it gave a
				little more definition and helped solidify what she was interested in and her capabilities through it all.

		  <h2> Urban Arts: School of Interactive Arts (2018 - Present) </h2> <br>

			<p>
				 In SIA Courtney has learned an incredible amount about ways of thinking about different problems and how
				 to approach them in a certain mindset. In addition to that, it has given her the chance to work on many projects that relate
				 to hobbies that she enjoys. Within the program, she learned a new language as well as different programs such as the
				 Unity Game Engine and C# language. She plans to progress in the courses they provide on game design and take advanced courses
				 later on through my senior year of highschool.

			<h3> Staff 6 Technology and Communications </h3> <br>
			<p>
					In her staff, she currently holds the positiion of Non-Commissioned Officer in Command Senior (NCOIC). Some of the various
					tasks that the staff does is set up for a multitude of events. Some of the events we go to the sound booth in our school and
					sets up videos to preview, projectors, mixers, microphones, walkie talkies, audio, and lighting. Other events are similar set ups but more portable
					by not using the auditorium speakers and setting up different types of amplifiers. Other duties include maintaining the website for
					our Patriot Battlion and fixing and maintaining the quality of the equipment that JROTC owns such as desktops, laptops, printers,
					copiers, televisions, and any other appliances listed above. Moreover, we handle carving nameplates with a gravograph for all of the cadets
					in our battalion. What we do to make nameplates is a long process through several computer applications as well as coordinating all of our lists
					with the list of cadets that our army instructors give them. Mostly we get lists of last names to be made to get engraved on the nameplates; then
					making models for them in AutoDesk ArtCam.
