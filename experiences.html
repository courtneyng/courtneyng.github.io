		  <h2> Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program (2018) </h2> <br>

			<p>
				During the summer, I was accepted into a coding program that empowers girls and creates a sisterhood among the girls.
				Within the program we were offered many opportunities to meet many different people as well as gain connections with the people
				we meet. It has built a sense of community through all the people who were involved in the summer program. Career wise, it gave a
				little more definition and helped solidify what I was interested in and my capabilities through it all.

		  <h2> Urban Arts: School of Interactive Arts (2018 - Present) </h2> <br>

			<p>
				 In my experience so far I have learned an incredible amount about ways of thinking about different problems and how
				 to approach them in a certain mindset. In addition to that, it has given me the chance to work on many projects that relate
				 to hobbies that I enjoy a lot. Within the program, I have learned a new language as well as different programs such as the
				 Unity Game Engine and C# language. I plan to progress in the courses they provide on game design and take advanced courses
				 later on through my senior year of highschool.

			<h3> Staff 6 Technology and Communications </h3> <br>
			<p>
					In my staff, currently I hold the positiion of Non-Commissioned Officer in Command Senior (NCOIC). Some of the various
					tasks that we do are set up for a multitude of events. Some of the events we go to the sound booth in our school and we
					set up videos to preview, projectors, mixers, microphones, walkie talkies, audio, and lighting. Other events are similar set ups but more portable
					by not using the auditorium speakers and setting up different types of amplifiers. Other duties include maintaining the website for
					our Patriot Battlion and fixing and maintaining the quality of the equipment that JROTC owns such as desktops, laptops, printers,
					copiers, televisions, and any other appliance listed above.
